# Conditional Independence Testing with Generative Adversarial Networks

This is a python implementation of the algorithm in the paper ["Conditional Independence Testing with Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04068.pdf). The goal of this project is to test conditional independence between variable sets X and Y conditional on Z. It contains synthetic data generation to understand the behaviour of our test in various settings and exisiting tests used in the literature for comparison.
